- 👋 Hi, I’m @tapOnBoss
- //.
- ✨ I’m interested in  -->veteran IT managers.--> My ideas on how to work effectively with each type follow --> the descriptions....
- //.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... -->Human Bottleneck: These techies either demand to do all the coding, or never finish their work, or both. Impress upon them that quality is often the opposite of perfectionism. Also, feed them small, well-defined tasks and praise any competent output that is on schedule.
//.
- 🌱 Bright Green: These straight-out-of-college developers like the new, cool technology. They tend to over-engineer by exploiting all the bells and whistles of the development environment–even when it’s inappropriate. These “green” techies often rely on their planet-size intellects to help them get back on schedule in predelivery all-nighters. Introduce them to colleagues who recently were Bright Green but learned the hard way to focus on deliverables.
//.
- 🌱 Tried-But-Untested: Their mantra is “Hey, we’ve got a whole testing team, why should I worry about checking my code?” It’s a guarantee that these specimens will cause you grief, so it’s essential to pull them up short. You’ll be doing them a favor in the long term.
//.
- 🌱 Techno-Babbler: Their code doesn’t work because they “need” something. These techies spend too much time in newsgroups and fail to realize that overusing jargon is not a sign of adulthood. Require these techies to give an acronym-free, from-first-principles explanation of project results to management.
//.
- 🌱 User-Loser: These techies consider many client questions stupid and deem the client worthy of a verbal flame. This often leads to the client not doing business with your company in the future. If your developers have contempt for “suits,” try introducing a “dress-up Wednesday”–and keep them away from outside phone contact.
//.
- 🌱 Task Farmer: As your self-appointed deputy, he or she assumes that the project plan is only a guideline and that it’s acceptable for team members to swap roles and tasks without asking you. Clarify that, while this person’s suggestions are welcome, you’re the one who carries the weight of the project.
//.
- 🌱 Under The Radar: This colleague has a tendency to generate maximally obscure code. This is usually a way to hide inelegance of implementation and to secure employment by preventing any other developers from working on his or her input. A curative strategy is to make the techie responsible for technical mentoring of a demanding Bright Green team member.
//.
- 🌱 Winging-It Commander: The techie’s curriculum vitae says he or she is proficient in Java, SQL, and Perl, but their lines of code are sparse and curiously primitive. This techie will also place unusual demands on other team members to help “debug” their deliverables. Projects can’t accommodate this level of on-the-job training. Encourage team members to be honest about their technical comfort zones by offering them appropriate training opportunities.
//.
- 🌱 Prima Donna: This character simply won’t tackle mundane tasks. And, if you suggest that they have to adapt existing code, there’s always a performance of operatic proportions. Make it clear that they’ll work for the technical author for a month if this nonsense persists.
//.
- 🌱 Gender Agenda: Some developers have trouble working for, or even alongside, colleagues of the opposite sex. Challenge their assumptions by introducing them to a cross-section of your most accomplished colleagues.

- 👀 Designing For The Best Experience For All Users
- 👀 Web pages can be viewed using many different devices: desktops, tablets, and phones. Your web page should look good, and be easy to use, regardless of the device.
- 👀 Web pages should not leave out information to fit smaller devices, but rather adapt its content to fit any device:

- 👀 It is called responsive web design when you use CSS and HTML to resize, hide, shrink, enlarge, or move the content to make it look good on any screen.
//.
